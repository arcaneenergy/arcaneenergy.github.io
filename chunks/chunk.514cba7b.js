## Description

**Play in unique environments, overcome traps and falls and reach the end of the level to advance.**

---

**Introduction**

**How to play**

Use the left and right buttons to move in the given direction. Use the up arrow button to fly up in the air. Moving and
flying burns a given amount of fuel. Flying uses more fuel than left and right movement. To fill up the tank, release
all buttons and wait a few seconds for the fuel to recharge. Any movement will interrupt the charging process and you
will have to wait again.

You can find the menu button in the top left corner. Use it to return to the main menu or restart from the last
checkpoint or restart the level.

**Main Menu**

Here you can toggle the sound, change the rendering quality, and enable or disable infinite fuel. You can also find
information about the game and other contact information here.

**Infinite fuel**

This option allows you to move freely in all levels without the need for charging. To activate this option, you must
first finish the game.

**Performance issues**

Cycle through the quality options in the main menu. This changes the rendering quality of the game and has a huge impact
on the performance.
