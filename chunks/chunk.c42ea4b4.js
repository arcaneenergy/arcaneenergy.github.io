Complete quests and earn achievements to collect coins and purchase elements. Adapt your world to different day and weather conditions and watch elements interact.\n\n### Day/Night-Cycle\nWith a naturally occurring day/night cycle or a manually configured one, you can easily turn day into night or night into day.\n\n### Fire and Explosion System\nLight up your sandbox with explosive energy! Start fires and put them out, watching elements burn and explosions ripple through. Elements burn through various factors, and explosions create dynamic impacts, influencing the elements in their vicinity.\n\n### Backpack\nYour backpack is the key to your elements. Choose an element of your choice from a variety of categories and place it into your world.\n\n### Entities\nWatch entities wander and bring a touch of life to your game. They will react to things around in their environment.\n\n### Weather System\nWithout weather, the world would feel dry. Add clouds and rain to your sandbox to enhance the experience. Feel the atmosphere change, turning your sandbox into a living, breathing masterpiece.\n\n### World Themes\nFrom a dense forest, to a bustling city, or a rocky mountain desert, each environment is a canvas for your imagination. These themes provide a unique backdrop for your sandbox.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<ImageGallery images={\n  [\n    "/posts/sandbox-elements/image-01.webp",\n    "/posts/sandbox-elements/image-02.webp",\n    "/posts/sandbox-elements/image-03.webp",\n    "/posts/sandbox-elements/image-04.webp",\n    "/posts/sandbox-elements/image-05.webp",\n    "/posts/sandbox-elements/image-06.webp",\n  ]\n} />\n\n## Trailer\n\n<Youtube videoId="5P42Vc4zp0Y" />\n';
