For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).\n\nNote that there is also a [Cheatsheet specific to Markdown Here](./Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) if that's what you're looking for. You can also check out [more Markdown tools](./Other-Markdown-Tools).\n\n##### Table of Contents  \n[Headers](#headers)  \n[Emphasis](#emphasis)  \n[Lists](#lists)  \n[Links](#links)  \n[Images](#images)  \n[Code and Syntax Highlighting](#code)  \n[Tables](#tables)  \n[Blockquotes](#blockquotes)  \n[Inline HTML](#html)  \n[Horizontal Rule](#hr)  \n[Line Breaks](#lines)  \n[YouTube Videos](#videos)  \n\n\n## Headers\n\n```no-highlight\n# H1\n## H2\n### H3\n#### H4\n##### H5\n###### H6\n\nAlternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:\n\nAlt-H1\n======\n\nAlt-H2\n------\n```\n\n# H1\n## H2\n### H3\n#### H4\n##### H5\n###### H6\n\nAlternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:\n\nAlt-H1\n======\n\nAlt-H2\n------\n\n\n## Emphasis\n\n```no-highlight\nEmphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.\n\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.\n\nCombined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.\n\nStrikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~\n```\n\nEmphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.\n\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.\n\nCombined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.\n\nStrikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~\n\n\n\n## Lists\n\n(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: \u22C5)\n\n```no-highlight\n1. First ordered list item\n2. Another item\n\u22C5\u22C5* Unordered sub-list. \n1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number\n\u22C5\u22C51. Ordered sub-list\n4.

They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\n\n```no-highlight\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the \nraw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\n\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\n--- | --- | ---\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n1 | 2 | 3\n```\n\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.

You can also use inline Markdown.\n\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\n--- | --- | ---\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n1 | 2 | 3\n\n\n## Blockquotes\n\n```no-highlight\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n```\n\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n\n\n## Inline HTML\n\nYou can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well. \n\n```no-highlight\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>\n</dl>\n```\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n\n## Horizontal Rule\n\n```\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n***\n\nAsterisks\n\n___\n\nUnderscores\n```\n\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n***\n\nAsterisks\n\n___\n\nUnderscores\n\n\n## Line Breaks\n\nMy basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &lt;Enter&gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend. \n\nHere are some things to try out:\n\n```\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n```\n\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also begins a separate paragraph, but...  \nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n\n(Technical note: *Markdown Here* uses GFM line breaks, so there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)\n\n<a name=\"videos\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## YouTube Videos\n\nThey can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:\n\n```no-highlight\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg\" \nalt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\n```\n\nOr, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:\n\n```no-highlight\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)\n```\n\nReferencing a bug by #bugID in your git commit links it to the slip. For example #1. \n\n---\n\nLicense: [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\n";
