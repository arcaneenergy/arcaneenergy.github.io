## Description

The backrooms are a mysterious and complex labyrinth of interconnected dimensions, hidden just beyond the threshold
of our everyday reality. For some, they are a place of unimaginable horror and darkness, where the laws of physics
and time are twisted and distorted. For others, they are a realm of endless possibility and exploration, offering
glimpses into alternate universes and strange new worlds.
