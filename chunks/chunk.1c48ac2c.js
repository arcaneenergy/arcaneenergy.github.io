Use the up arrow button to fly up in the air. Moving and\nflying burns a given amount of fuel. Flying uses more fuel than left and right movement. To fill up the tank, release\nall buttons and wait a few seconds for the fuel to recharge. Any movement will interrupt the charging process and you\nwill have to wait again.\n\nYou can find the menu button in the top left corner. Use it to return to the main menu or restart from the last\ncheckpoint or restart the level.\n\n**Main Menu**\n\nHere you can toggle the sound, change the rendering quality, and enable or disable infinite fuel. You can also find\ninformation about the game and other contact information here.\n\n**Infinite fuel**\n\nThis option allows you to move freely in all levels without the need for charging. To activate this option, you must\nfirst finish the game.\n\n**Performance issues**\n\nCycle through the quality options in the main menu. This changes the rendering quality of the game and has a huge impact\non the performance.\n\n## YouTube Playlist\n\n<Youtube videoId="videoseries?list=PLKnVIoBRwyaP3cxJnfaEJMsi8_MFeCNaa" />\n';
