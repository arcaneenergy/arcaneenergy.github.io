Download this [repository](https://github.com/arcaneenergy/godot-multimesh-scatter) or download the addon from the asset library inside Godot.\n    - Import the addons folder into your project (if it already isn't present).\n2. Activate the MultiMesh Scatter addon under Project > Project Settings > Plugins. If an error dialog appears, restart the engine and try activating it again.\n3. Add a MultiMeshScatter node to the scene.\n\n### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes\n\n- The sphere placement type takes `placement_size.x` for the radius. The y and z values are not used.\n- The sphere placement type behaves more like a capsule shape. This means that only the horizontal radius is taken into account when scattering meshes.\n- Scattering occurs automatically in the editor whenever you change a parameter or move the MultiMeshScatter node. In game mode, the scatter occurs once at the beginning of the game.\n\n### üóíÔ∏è License\n\n[MIT License](/LICENSE.md)\n\n## Video\n\n<Youtube videoId=\"2fa4guxq6iU\" />","src/content/posts/multimesh-scatter.mdx","176b5196fa4f84b2","multimesh-scatter.mdx","rocket-bounce",{id:129,data:131,body:137,filePath:138,digest:139,legacyId:140,deferredRender:27},{title:132,description:133,datetime:134,cover:135,tags:136},"Rocket Bounce","Fly and bounce around to overcome obstacles and levels.",["Date","2020-02-16T00:00:00.000Z"],"/posts/rocket-bounce/banner.webp",[110,20,21,22],"import Youtube from \"@components/Youtube.astro\";\nimport GooglePlayButton from \"@components/GooglePlayButton.astro\";\nimport ImageGallery from \"@components/ImageGallery.astro\";\n\n<GooglePlayButton embedId=\"com.ArcaneEnergy.RocketBounce\" />\n\n## Description\n\nFly around and avoid obstacles to win levels.\n\nDrag around the rocket and release when you are ready to fly.

It's used to load in JSON files into Godot to recreate the levels at\nruntime. The exported JSON file contains all levels and individual cells. This makes it easy to recreate the level in\nGodot.\n\nAlternatively, you can use this program to easily create levels in the editor.\n\n### Controls\n\n<kbd>Left click</kbd>: Place tile (if a tile is selected)\n\n<kbd>Right click</kbd>: Delete tile\n\n<kbd>Tab</kbd>: Toggle GUI\n\n<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Scroll up</kbd>: Increase brush size\n\n<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Scroll down</kbd>: Decrease brush size\n\n<kbd>Middle mouse drag</kbd>: Drag camera\n\n<kbd>W</kbd>/<kbd>A</kbd>/<kbd>S</kbd>/<kbd>D</kbd>: Move camera\n\n<kbd>‚Üë</kbd>/<kbd>‚Üê</kbd>/<kbd>‚Üì</kbd>/<kbd>‚Üí</kbd>: Move camera\n\nMouse scroll up/down: Zoom in/out\n\n### UI Overview\n\nCreate new layers with the `+ New Layer` button. This brings up a dialog box for selecting an image file. After\nselecting a file, the new layer appears in the list.\n\nSwitch between layers by pressing the arrow to the left of the layer. This will open the tileset on the left. Use the up\nand down arrow keys to move layers.\n\n![Image 1](/posts/tilemap-level-editor/image-01.webp)\n\nSelect a tile and start drawing.\n\n![Image 2](/posts/tilemap-level-editor/image-02.webp)\n\nChange the size and shape of the cursor using the buttons in the lower right corner.\n\n![Image 3](/posts/tilemap-level-editor/image-03.webp)\n\n### Exported JSON file\n\nThe exported JSON file might look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layers\": [\n    {\n      \"texture_path\": \"C:/tilemap-level-editor/test/tileset.png\",\n      \"cells\": [[4, -5, -3]]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"objects\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"player\",\n      \"position\": [2, 4]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nEach cell contains an ID, an x and a y position. The ID is used to identify which cell in the tileset it refers to.\n\n### Problems\n\n- [ ] Currently, the program only supports tiles of 16x16 size. The spritesheet needs to be divisible by 16 (16, 32, 48,\n      64 etc.)\n- [ ] Exported texture paths are absolute.\n\n## Video\n\n<Youtube videoId=\"01ktb-9E6J0\" />","src/content/posts/tilemap-level-editor.mdx","4d050c8a1fef9da8","tilemap-level-editor.mdx","top-down-shooter-tutorial-series",{id:203,data:205,body:213,filePath:214,digest:215,legacyId:216,deferredRender:27},{title:206,description:207,datetime:208,cover:209,tags:210},"Top Down Shooter Tutorial Series","Learn how to create a Top Down Shooter in a 5-part tutorial series.",["Date","2021-12-07T00:00:00.000Z"],"/posts/top-down-shooter-tutorial-series/banner.webp",[19,211,212],"tutorial","post","import Youtube from \"@components/Youtube.astro\";\n\nThis tutorial series focuses on different parts of game development.\n\nYou will learn:\n\n- How to use a singleton.\n- Creating custom inputs and user-defined signals.\n- How to create a Player who can move, turn and attack.\n- How to create enemies that can move, turn and attack a target.\n- Common attack and health system.\n- Create a simple user interface\n- GUI Skinning (Themes)\n- Connecting the interface with game code.\n- Create a simple main menu.\n\n---\n\n## Tutorial #1: Creating the Player\n\nTutorial 1/5\n\nThis tutorial will focus on creating a basic game structure and player character.
